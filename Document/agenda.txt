VPN-Prevention

Determining if a network packet is coming from a device that is using a VPN app can be a challenging task, as VPN traffic is 
often encrypted and may appear similar to regular traffic. However, there are a few strategies you can employ to identify VPN traffic:

1. VPN Server IP Addresses: Many VPN services use specific IP ranges for their servers. You can maintain a list of known 
    VPN server IP addresses and compare the source IP address of incoming packets against this list. If the source IP matches a known 
    VPN server, it's likely VPN traffic.

2.VPN Protocol Detection: VPNs typically use specific protocols such as OpenVPN, IPSec, or WireGuard.
    By analyzing the packet headers, you may be able to identify patterns specific to these protocols.
    For example, OpenVPN often uses UDP port 1194 or TCP port 443.

3.Deep Packet Inspection (DPI): DPI involves inspecting the contents of network packets to determine the
    application or protocol generating the traffic. You can use DPI techniques to look for characteristics 
    unique to VPN protocols, such as packet structure, header fields, or encryption patterns.

4.DNS Requests: VPN clients often use specific DNS servers provided by the VPN service.
    By monitoring DNS requests, you can look for queries to known VPN DNS servers, indicating VPN usage.

5.Behavioral Analysis : VPN traffic may exhibit certain behavioral patterns, such as large amounts of
    traffic to a single IP address, frequent connections to multiple geographic locations, or sudden 
    changes in traffic volume. By analyzing traffic patterns, you may be able to detect VPN usage.

6.Third-Party Tools: There are third-party services and libraries available that specialize in
    detecting VPN traffic. These tools often employ advanced techniques such as machine learning or 
    crowdsourced data to identify VPN usage.
